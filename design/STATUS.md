# matryoshka-tk STATUS

## Rules
- Read STATUS.md in full each session. It says where we are and what is next.
- Session Log lives in STATUS-LOG.md (append-only, newest entries at top). Do NOT read it by default — append new entries there without reading the rest. Read STATUS-LOG.md only when explicitly asked (history audit, "what did we do about X", resolving a specific past-decision question).
- No git directly. Owner does git.
- No skipping stages. Each stage passes before the next.
- No real code before infrastructure (Stage 0) is verified.
- Show intent before code changes. Get owner approval.
- Plan approval is NOT code change approval.
- Architectural changes need explicit owner approval.
- Never overwrite any doc. New version with incremented suffix (-001, -002, etc.). Update cross-references. Applies to all docs, no exceptions.
- Post-stage cleanup: after all kitchen scripts pass, revise all code for obsolete parts, wrong comments, repeated code extractable to reusable sources. Fix, re-run all three scripts. Session log must have a "Post-stage cleanup" row — its absence means the rule was skipped.
- Plan versioning: after each completed stage, create new plan version. Collapse done stages to one-line summaries. Update context.md and STATUS.md to point to new version.
- Tests before examples: examples cannot start until all tests pass all kitchen scripts. Stage N.a = impl + tests, Stage N.b = examples. No mixing.

## Constraints for Next Agent (MUST)
- Git disabled. Do NOT run any git commands.
- Coding style: LE imports, explicit types, explicit dereference, stdlib first, errdefer/defer for resource cleanup.
- Doc style: short sentences, bullets, no AI-sh words. See plan Section 1.
- Run verification via kitchen scripts, not manual zig commands.
- Redirect kitchen script output to zig-out/ log files: `bash kitchen/script.sh > zig-out/script.log 2>&1`. Read the log file. Do NOT analyze shell stdout.
- AI-sh scan after every stage that changes *.md or *.zig.

## Decisions
- STATUS.md first, updated after every stage.
- Document rules apply to all markdown.
- condition_waitTimeout copied from legacy mailbox (Open Item 5).
- Tests check implementation. Examples show real usage patterns and stress-test.
- Examples have test wrappers. Examples come after tested code.
- Scenarios re-partitioned into tests + examples (Stage 0.5).
- Helper code (NodeMixin, Event, Sensor) developed in same stage as the code it supports.

## Open Items (carried from collected-context-001.md)
- 5  condition_waitTimeout workaround
- 6  Io.Evented backend not tested
- 10 which Layer 2-3 examples need real threads
- 11 panic test style in Zig
- 12 real-Io examples are integration tests, gate by platform
- 13 rare ReleaseSmall race in pool_fan_in (053) — see Session Log 2026-07-03 for full trace. Suspected upstream Zig 0.16 `Io.Threaded` bug, not app code. Not reproducible outside stress loop.

DOC 7 — populate Building Blocks with one topic: Observable by human (rule + pattern). DONE.  
DOC 8 — populate Building Blocks with the four core concepts: PolyNode/Mailbox/Pool/Master. DONE.  
API 3 — mailbox.wakeUpAll(). DONE (167/167 tests). Plan version 032 created.  
DOC 9 — re-partition and logically reorder the API reference (api-reference-017 →  
-018); std.Io-generic material moved to Addendums/Io 101; Change-manifest repetition  
dropped. DONE (doc-only, 167/167 tests unchanged). Plan version 033 created.  
DOC 10 — dependency-order the API reference (api-reference-018 → -019): send/receive  
diagrams into mailbox, Tag identity after pool, Slot-based programming + Cooperative  
cleanup patterns after pool — nothing used before it is introduced. DONE (doc-only,  
167/167 tests unchanged). Plan version 034 created.  
DOC 11 — write matryoshka-manifesto-002.md: consolidated README + matryoshka-tk-model +  
matryoshka-master + master-Tk mindset into one persuasion-first manifesto (one  
constraint, Master is a role, four fundamental concepts, Io as hidden transport behind  
Mailboxes, start small). DONE (doc-only, 167/167 tests unchanged). Plan version 035  
created.  
DOC 12 — de-smart the manifesto (manifesto-002 → -003): abstract architect-speak  
("application model", "execution model", "autonomous", "reason about locally")  
rewritten into plain human language; structure, diagrams, tables unchanged. DONE  
(doc-only, 167/167 tests unchanged). Plan version 036 created.  
DOC 13 — unified pattern/idiom catalog (patterns-009 → patterns-010): both halves  
merged, api-reference pattern material (cooperative cleanup, infra-handle transport,  
no-raw-allocator) absorbed, no repetition, logical order. DONE (doc-only, 167/167  
tests unchanged). Plan version 037 created.  
DOC 14 — audited Odin `matryoshka/kitchen/docs` for patterns/idioms missing from  
patterns-010; added 7 new catalog entries (Request-Response, Pipeline, Fan-In,  
Fan-Out, Shutdown via Exit message, Thread-is-container, Intrusive node embedding)  
to patterns-011.md, all pointing at existing Zig examples; 3 advanced/niche  
patterns with no example (self-send, function-pointer-as-tag,  
descriptor-struct-as-tag) explicitly skipped, owner confirmed. DONE (doc-only,  
167/167 tests unchanged). Plan version 038 created.  
DOC 15 — added `///`/`//!` doc comments to `src/polynode.zig`, `src/mailbox.zig`,  
`src/pool.zig`, `src/matryoshka.zig` (file headers + every `pub` declaration),  
sourced from matryoshka-api-reference-019.md; excluded `src/internal/cond_timeout.zig`  
(temporary workaround). Lifted the src/ `///` ban: rules-010.md → rules-011.md.  
DONE (167/167 tests unchanged, `zig build docs` clean). Plan version 039 pending.  
DOC 16 — polish pass on `src/*.zig` doc comments: fixed banned word "ensure"  
in `pool.zig`; dropped "ownership" language for send/place + one-place/one-state  
phrasing; split long comment lines into staccato bullets; new rule  
`rules-011.md` → `rules-012.md` (no ownership language, no `.md` refs in  
`src/` comments). DONE (167/167 tests unchanged, `zig build docs` clean).  
DOC 16b — gap-fix: 6 missed ownership hits reworded, `mailbox.zig`/`pool.zig`/  
`polynode.zig` file headers restructured to std.Io-style intro+bullets, stray  
line removed; new rule `rules-012.md` → `rules-013.md` (sweep-verification  
rule + header staccato standard). DONE (167/167 tests unchanged, `zig build  
docs` clean).  
DOC 17 — snake_case entry points, fix autodoc "Declaration not found" bug.  
DONE (167/167 tests unchanged). rules-013.md → rules-014.md.  
DOC 17b/17c — example doc comments moved to file-level `//!`; ASCII  
Ownership diagrams wrapped in fenced code blocks; fixed 056-pipeline's  
un-renamed `Pipeline` entry point. DONE (167/167 tests unchanged).  
rules-014.md → rules-015.md.  
DOC 18 — humanized the API reference (api-reference-019 → -020): dropped  
"ownership" framing throughout, staccato pass on remaining prose; re-synced  
src/mailbox.zig and src/pool.zig doc comments to match (src/polynode.zig and  
src/matryoshka.zig already matched). DONE (167/167 tests unchanged).  
DOC 18b — new rule: `//!` file-level block must end with a bare `//!` +  
blank line. rules-015.md → rules-016.md. SUPERSEDED by DOC 18c — the  
blank-line hypothesis was tested against real rendered docs and disproved.  
DOC 18c — root-caused via headless-Chrome render: Zig autodoc splices the  
first declaration's `///` comment onto the container page unconditionally.  
Fix: `const _doc_stub = void;` as first declaration in mailbox.zig/pool.zig/  
polynode.zig. rules-016.md → rules-017.md. DONE (167/167 tests unchanged).  
API 4 — Renamed `NodeHandle` → `ItemHandle` (src, examples, stories, design docs);  
documented `ih` short-form and `handle` shorthand convention. DONE (167/167  
tests unchanged). Plan version pending.  
API 4b — Propagated the rename to `kitchen/docs/` site pages and regenerated  
autodocs. DONE.  
DOC 19 — moved GitHub Pages generated site from `kitchen/output/` to  
root-level `docs/` (standard Pages folder name). DONE.  
INTR 6 — DONE (167/167 tests). Split standalone `helpers/` build module into  
`examples/items/` (4 item types + `items.zig` lifecycle helpers),  
`examples/hooks/` (`AlwaysCreateHooks.zig`, `CappedPoolHooks.zig`,  
`hooks.zig`), `examples/helpers/` (generic `expect`/`clearList` only).  
Updated `build.zig` to drop the standalone helpers module and wire `smod`  
to `examples`. ~68 call-site files updated. Old `helpers/` folder deleted.  
Plan version 039 created.  
DOC 20 — DONE (167/167 tests). Removed the 8 example-autodoc `zig build docs`  
targets (`layer1docs`..`layer4docs`, `itemsdocs`, `hooksdocs`, `helpersdocs`,  
`storiesdocs`) and their `build.zig` support code; `apidocs` untouched. New  
permanent `kitchen/tools/gen_examples_docs.sh` mirrors `examples/`+`stories/`  
into `kitchen/docs/examples/` as generated `.md` pages (description + diagram  
verbatim, embedded source, GitHub-blob link); 6 hand-authored catalog/group  
pages replace `examples_reference.md`. rules-019 → -020, docs-plan-014 → -015,  
plan-039 → -040.  
DOC 20 follow-up — DONE. Owner found the 76 mirrored example pages were  
link-only orphans (built by mkdocs but absent from `nav:`). Added every  
example to `kitchen/mkdocs.yml`'s Examples Catalog `nav:` under its group;  
new rule (rules-020 → -021): examples-catalog nav sync — any `examples/`/  
`stories/` file add/remove/rename must update `nav:` + group pages.  
Current: 167/167 tests. DOC 20 + follow-up DONE.  
DOC 21 — "The Shape of a Real System" page (kitchen/docs/the-shape.md): two  
Graphviz diagrams (real-system.dot / matryoshka-solution.dot) mapping three  
ownership/reuse/coupling pains onto PolyNode/Mailbox/Pool, wired into  
mkdocs nav after manifesto.md. New permanent kitchen/diagrams/src/ +  
kitchen/tools/gen_diagrams.sh (manual-run, committed output, not CI-wired).  
README insertion deferred by owner. DONE (doc-only, 167/167 tests  
unchanged). Plan version pending.  
INTR 7 — DONE (167/167 tests). Pool `on_put` reset convention added to every  
example/test hook; "Pool is not storage" correction in  
matryoshka-architecture-foundation-4-003.md; `put`'s four hook-driven  
outcomes + no-fixed-sequence-guarantee caveat documented in  
matryoshka-api-reference-023.md + kitchen/docs pool pages; audit of all  
32 pool-touching files found and fixed 5 wrong-assumption bugs the reset  
surfaced. Diagram-notation fixes (053's `mbh[0..2]`/`×3`, repo-wide sweep)  
and a mailbox-focused equivalent stage deferred, owner's call.  
Staccato sweep — DONE (167/167 tests). Repo-wide audit found 9 files with  
prose-paragraph violations of the staccato rule; fixed 8 (video-transcoder.md  
and a lower-confidence bucket left untouched, owner's call). Followed by a  
"thread" audit — DONE (167/167 tests): worker-finish-signal pattern's stale  
"spawns a worker thread"/"joins the thread" language corrected to  
`io.concurrent`/future-await across `matryoshka-api-reference-025.md`,  
`patterns-015.md`, and two `kitchen/docs` mirrors; 5 stale  
`matryoshka-api-reference-022.md` cross-references in patterns-015.md fixed.  
LANDING 1 — src/ LOC counter (non-recursive, excludes empty/comment/import  
lines; design/src-loc-counter-001.md) + badge next to API button on  
`kitchen/docs/index.md`, shared logic in `kitchen/tools/src_loc.py` used by  
both the mkdocs build-time hook (`kitchen/hooks/count_lines.py`) and a  
standalone script (`kitchen/tools/count_src_loc.sh`); API button hidden via  
CSS (`display: none`, markup kept). DONE (doc/tooling-only, 167/167 tests  
unchanged).

**Next stage**: CANDIDATES (composed README + landing docs from a repo-wide  
`.md` audit, `design/candidates/`) — requirements-gathering done, execution  
not started, blocked on owner confirming Pass 1 subagent-sweep approach. Then  
MDFIX (markdown hard-break rule + `fix_md_hardbreaks.sh` tooling). Deferred:  
diagram-notation sweep, mailbox-focused pool-audit equivalent, showcase-post  
variants (Ziggit/Discord/Reddit) — all owner's call on order.
